<h1>ARBORIO RICE</h1>

<p><strong>Arborio Rice</strong> is named after a town in northwest Italy, that is one of the most popular varieties used for 
Italian risotto recipes. Arborio rice is a short-grain variety that is very plump and like other Italian rice varieties, it contains 
more starch than many other types of rice. The starch is an important component for creating creamy dishes, such as risotto, so it 
is important not to rinse the rice before cooking or else much of the starch can be washed away. Besides risotto, Arborio rice is 
used in dishes such as stir-fried rice, sushi, pudding, and recipes where rice is molded into shapes. It is available in well-stocked 
food stores and Italian markets.</p>

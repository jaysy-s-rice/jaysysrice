<h1>BLACK RICE</h1>

<p><strong>Black rice</strong>, also known as <strong>purple rice</strong>, is a range of rice types of the species Oryza sativa, some of which are glutinous rice. 
Black rice is also known as <strong>'Forbidden Rice'</strong> in ancient China since only those belonging to the upper class could afford to eat it. Black rice has 
a deep black color and usually turns deep purple when cooked. Its dark purple color is primarily due to its anthocyanin content, which is higher by weight than that 
of other colored grains. It is suitable for creating porridge, dessert, traditional Chinese black rice cake, bread, and noodles.</p>

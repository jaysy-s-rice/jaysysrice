<h1>RED CARGO RICE</h1>

<p><strong>Red cargo rice</strong> is a type of unpolished rice, that is, rice that has retained its inner bran layers. By contrast, polished rice has been milled to remove its husk, 
bran, and germ. The name <strong>“red cargo rice”</strong> comes from the fact that it used to be exported in bulk. This marked a difference from white rice, which 
was pre-packaged before exportation.</p>
